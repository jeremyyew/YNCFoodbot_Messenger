# YNCFoodbot_Messenger

Facebook Messenger chatbot that sends information and links about food options around Yale-NUS campus. 
Chat with the bot on messenger at this page: https://www.facebook.com/YNC-Foodbot-979027202238929/. 

I used https://tsaprailis.com/2016/06/02/How-to-build-and-deploy-a-Facebook-Messenger-bot-with-Python-and-Flask-a-tutorial/ to start. 

## Learning points: 

Through this project so far, I have learned a little bit about: 

- Facebook messenger API
- HTML requests
- Webscraping with Xpath
- using curl/shell script

## To-do

### Features to add:

- [] Send Al Amaan Menu (+ upload al amaan menu). 

### Features to explore: 

- [] NLP interaction ("Order buttery food")
- [] Notification subscription ("What's cookin'?")
- [] More content ("Discover new food places"). Find a food blogger. 

### Misc: 

- [] Edit "Others" carousel
- [] Add "Share" image.
- [] Get feedback. 
- [] Check FB review requirements, send for review 
- [] When school reopens: update timings, update/test webscraper, delete false links,

### Other chatbot ideas: 

- [] YNC general info, memes/comics subscription
