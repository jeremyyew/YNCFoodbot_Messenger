# YNCFoodbot_Messenger

Still in development. 
Facebook Messenger chatbot that sends information and links about food options around Yale-NUS campus. 
Chat with the bot on messenger at this page: https://www.facebook.com/YNC-Foodbot-979027202238929/ (currently not available as it is has not been published). 

I used https://tsaprailis.com/2016/06/02/How-to-build-and-deploy-a-Facebook-Messenger-bot-with-Python-and-Flask-a-tutorial/ to start. 

Hosted on Heroku. 

## Learning points: 

Through this project (so far), I have learned a little bit about: 

- Facebook messenger API
- HTML requests
- Webscraping with Xpath
- using curl/shell script

## To-do

### Features:

- [X] Get Started message

- [X] Carousel message 
- [X] Persistent menu 
- [X] Tried out Lists and Quick Replies

### Small stuff: 

- [ ] Edit "Others" carousel

### Features to explore: 

- [ ] NLP interaction ("Order buttery food")

### Misc: 

- [ ] Get feedback.
